Recently, I bought a 3d printer and printed a <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1466118-wheel-fitment-tool#profileId-1529435"> wheel fitment tool</a>. Use this tool to determine if the specs of a wheel/rim will properly fit your car. With this in mind I wanted to see If I could build my own.

To start off we need to understand the bolt pattern. Ex: 5x114.3, 5x4.5, 4x4.5, 6x135. The first number represents the number of lug holes. The 2nd number is the diameter of the circle which those lug holes sit. The number of lugs can vary, but most common for passenger cars are 4,5 and 6. For 4 & 6 lug, the lugs sit center on the diameter of the circle (2nd number in the bolt pattern). For 5, its the top of one lug across diagionally to the center of the other point.
